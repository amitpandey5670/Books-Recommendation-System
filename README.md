# K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm

The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple,
easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems.
A supervised machine learning algorithm (as opposed to an unsupervised machine learning algorithm) is one that relies on 
labeled input data to learn a function that produces an appropriate output when given new unlabeled data.
